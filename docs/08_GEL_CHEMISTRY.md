08_GEL_CHEMISTRY — AMNION-ORACLE (Concept-Level Notes)

Project: AMNION-ORACLE  
Type: Concept-level material notes  
Scope: Gel behavior as a stability medium (no recipes)  
Status: Reference notes (NOT clinical, NOT production)

0. Non-medical / non-clinical disclaimer
AMNION-ORACLE is a concept-level engineering reference.
It is **NOT** a medical device and **NOT** intended for clinical use.


1. Purpose of gel layer (concept)
Gel is treated as a physical stability medium / buffer that can:
- damp rapid fluctuations
- stabilize coupling interfaces
- retain structured phase behavior

This document does NOT provide chemical recipes or synthesis steps.


2. Target properties (engineering)
- viscosity stability over temperature
- long-term phase stability
- low degradation / low drift
- controllable damping response
- non-reactive with housing materials


3. System-level parameters
- viscosity index (vs temperature)
- damping coefficient proxy
- aging drift curve
- humidity sensitivity
- thermal expansion considerations


4. Safety notes
- treat all materials as potentially hazardous until proven safe
- avoid volatile solvents for any practical prototype
- storage and disposal must follow standard safety rules


5. Verification (concept)
- stability tests over time (days/weeks)
- thermal cycle test
- drift measurement vs baseline
- repeatability of damping behavior
