03_SAFETY_LOGIC — AMNION-ORACLE
Project: AMNION-ORACLE  
Type: Safety / guard logic specification  
Status: Documentation-first (no clinical use)

0) Non-medical / non-clinical disclaimer
AMNION-ORACLE is a concept-level engineering reference.  
It is NOT a medical device and NOT intended for clinical use.

Safety loop position in system
`sense → preprocess → estimate → metrics → guard → control → actuate → log`

Guard is evaluated BEFORE any control action.  
If Guard rejects state, system must NOT call `control()`.

1) Safety goal
The system must remain stable, predictable, and non-destructive under:
- power mismatch
- phase mismatch / drift
- noisy input signals
- missing sensors / invalid data
- external disturbances
- operator errors

Primary invariant: Do no harm (system + operator + environment).

2) Parameter naming (canonical)
- gain -> G
- coupling -> K
- damping -> D
- power limit -> P_max
- power budget -> P_budget
- power budget min -> P_budget_min
- power budget soft -> P_budget_soft

3) Guard evaluation order (canonical)
Guard processes inputs in strict sequence:
1. Sensor validity check
2. Power budget check
3. Phase mismatch check
4. Coherence / Q check
5. Rate-of-change check
6. State transition decision
7. Output patching (clamp / throttle / decouple / damp / cap)

No step may be skipped.  
If any step fails, Guard escalates state before control output is computed.

4) Core safety invariants
I1 — Power constraint  
- 0 ≤ P_draw ≤ P_max  
- soft saturation only (no hard cutoff)

I2 — Coherence constraint 
- coherence is never forced to “perfect”  
- coherence is stabilized by damping + decoupling

I3 — Phase stability 
- phase correction is gradual  
- no aggressive phase kicks

I4 — Conservative behavior on uncertainty (invalid/contradictory sensors)  
- reduce coupling  
- reduce gain  
- cap power  
- switch to safe mode

I5 — Deterministic logging  
Every critical decision logs:
- timestamp
- reason codes
- measurement snapshot
- hashes where relevant

5) Guard escalation priority (highest first)
1. Sensor invalid / missing
2. Power overflow
3. Coherence collapse
4. Phase runaway
5. Rate-of-change violation

Higher priority conditions always override lower ones.

6) Guard states
States:
- S0_NORMAL
- S1_THROTTLE
- S2_BARRIER
- S3_SAFE_HALT

Transitions:
- S0 -> S1 : threshold exceeded
- S1 -> S2 : severe mismatch OR sensor failure
- S2 -> S3 : repeated violation OR coherence < C_floor
- S2 -> S1 : parameters stabilized
- S1 -> S0 : all metrics within envelope
- S3 -> S0 : manual restart only

S1 — Warning / throttle
Triggered when: mismatch exceeds threshold OR coherence falls below target.  
Actions: G ↓, K ↓, D ↑, P_budget ↓ (soft cap).

S2 — Barrier mode (decouple + damp + cap)
Triggered when: mismatch severe OR runaway risk OR sensor failure/instability.  
Actions: K -> 0, D -> high, P_budget -> minimum, freeze fast adaptation loops.

S3 — Safe halt / lock
Triggered when: repeated instability OR multiple sensor failures OR coherence < floor.  
Actions: stop active control output; keep logging + minimal monitoring; require manual restart.

7) Barrier definition (canonical)
Barrier = decouple + damp + cap
- decouple: K -> 0
- damp: D ↑
- cap: P_budget ↓

Barrier ≠ phase flip (metaphor only).

8) Anti-oscillation rule
Hard cutoff creates oscillation (“saw behavior”). Therefore:
- use saturator (clamp)
- adaptive throttle near limits
- smooth transitions

Recommended:
- `P_draw = clamp(P_draw, 0, P_max)`
- reduce alpha as `P_draw -> P_max`

9) Safe parameter floors
- `Q = max(Q_min, Q + ΔQ)`
- Q must never go negative
- no runaway compensations

10) Sensor sanity checks
Before control update:
- range checks
- derivative checks (jumps)
- plausibility across sensors
- missing value handling

If invalid -> enter S1 or S2 depending on severity.

11) Logging schema (minimal)
Each guard decision logs:
- ts
- state
- P_draw, P_in, mismatch_power
- phi, phi_avg, mismatch_phase
- Q, coherence
- action_codes[]
- hash(snapshot)

12) Guard function (canonical)
Inputs: `state, metrics, config`  
Outputs: `(guard_state, patch)`

```pseudo
function guard(state, metrics, config):

    # ---- Aliases (canonical) ----
    P_max         = config.P_max
    P_budget_min  = config.P_budget_min
    P_budget_soft = config.P_budget_soft

    Q_crit     = config.Q_crit
    phase_trip = config.phase_trip
    rate_trip  = config.rate_trip
    rate_limit = config.rate_limit

    # ---- Patch definitions ----
    PATCH_NONE = patch(none)

    # Barrier = decouple + damp + cap (hard)
    PATCH_BARRIER = patch(
        set_K(0),
        set_D_high(),
        set_P_budget(P_budget_min),
        freeze_fast_adaptation()
    )

    # Throttle = conservative soft limitation
    PATCH_THROTTLE = patch(
        reduce_G(),
        reduce_K(),
        increase_D(),
        set_P_budget(P_budget_soft)
    )

    # 1) Sensor validity (highest priority)
    if sensors_invalid(metrics):
        return S2_BARRIER, PATCH_BARRIER

    # 2) Power overflow
    if metrics.P_draw > P_max:
        return S2_BARRIER, PATCH_BARRIER

    # 3) Coherence / Q collapse
    if metrics.Q <= Q_crit:
        return S2_BARRIER, PATCH_BARRIER

    # 4) Phase runaway
    if abs(metrics.phase_error) > phase_trip:
        return S2_BARRIER, PATCH_BARRIER

    # 5) Rate-of-change (two-tier)
    if abs(metrics.rate_change) > rate_trip:
        return S2_BARRIER, PATCH_BARRIER

    if abs(metrics.rate_change) > rate_limit:
        return S1_THROTTLE, PATCH_THROTTLE

    # 6) Normal envelope
    if within_envelope(metrics, config):
        return S0_NORMAL, PATCH_NONE

    # 7) Default conservative
    return S1_THROTTLE, PATCH_THROTTLE

13) Design principles

Safety logic is monotonic: the system may always become more conservative,
but never more aggressive after a violation.

AMNION-ORACLE remains documentation-first and non-clinical.
