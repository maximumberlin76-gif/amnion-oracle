14_LIMITATIONS_AND_NON_GOALS — AMNION-ORACLE (Limitations & Non-Goals)

Project: AMNION-ORACLE  
Type: Scope boundaries, limitations & explicit non-goals  
Status: Reference specification (NOT clinical)


Non-medical / non-clinical disclaimer

AMNION-ORACLE is a concept-level engineering reference.  
It is NOT a medical device and NOT intended for clinical use.


Purpose

Define what AMNION-ORACLE explicitly **does not attempt to be** and which problem
classes are outside scope.

Clear boundaries prevent misuse, misinterpretation, and scope creep.


L1 — Not a medical system

AMNION-ORACLE is NOT:

- a diagnostic device  
- a therapeutic device  
- a life-support system  
- a clinical decision system  

Any medical usage is outside scope.


L2 — Not an artificial general intelligence

AMNION-ORACLE does not attempt to:

- reason about arbitrary domains  
- exhibit human-like cognition  
- perform autonomous goal generation  

It is a control & safety architecture, not a mind.


L3 — Not a security appliance

AMNION-ORACLE is NOT:

- a firewall  
- an intrusion detection system  
- a cryptographic platform  

Security features are limited to auditability and tamper-evidence.


L4 — No guarantee of optimal performance

The system does not guarantee:

- maximum efficiency  
- minimal energy usage  
- fastest response  

Only stability and safety are guaranteed.


L5 — No prediction of unknown physics

AMNION-ORACLE does not claim:

- discovery of new physical laws  
- validation of speculative physics  
- completeness of physical models  

All models are approximations.


L6 — No autonomy over safety invariants

The system cannot redefine its own invariants.

Any attempt to self-modify ethics or safety logic is invalid.


L7 — No responsibility for misuse

If deployed outside documented scope:

- responsibility lies with operator  
- system makes no guarantees  


L8 — Limited environment assumptions

AMNION-ORACLE assumes:

- bounded power  
- bounded sensors  
- bounded actuators  

Unbounded environments are outside scope.


L9 — No silent operation

System is not designed to operate invisibly.

Logging and observability are mandatory.


L10 — No “always-on” promise

System may:

- refuse to start  
- halt  
- require manual restart  

This is correct behavior.


Summary

AMNION-ORACLE is a stability-first control architecture.

It intentionally sacrifices:

- universality  
- raw performance  
- autonomy  

in favor of:

- predictability  
- auditability  
- safety.
