AMNION-ORACLE is a concept-level engineering reference.  
It is NOT a medical device and NOT intended for clinical use.


A

Actuator  
Hardware or simulated interface that applies control output to a system.

Actuation  
Process of converting control signal into physical or simulated effect.


B

Barrier  
Safety mode implementing: decouple + damp + cap power budget.

Brownout  
Supply voltage drop below safe operating range.


C

Clamp  
Function limiting a value to a safe range.

Coherence (C)  
Measure of temporal and phase alignment of system dynamics.

Control Frame  
Data structure carrying control outputs.


D

Damping (D)  
Parameter that dissipates energy and suppresses oscillation.

Decouple  
Reduce or null coupling coefficient K.

Degraded Mode  
Reduced-performance safe operation.


E

Envelope  
Allowed operating region for metrics.


G

Gain (G)  
Control amplification factor.

Guard  
Safety logic layer that validates metrics and may override control.


H

Hard Clamp  
Non-negotiable hardware-level limit.


I

Invariant  
Rule that must never be violated.


K

Coupling (K)  
Strength of interaction between subsystems.


L

Log Frame  
Deterministic record of one system tick.



M

Metrics Frame 
Computed stability and health indicators.


P

P_draw  
Power drawn by subsystem.

P_in  
Power supplied to subsystem.

P_max  
Maximum allowed power.

P_budget  
Current allowed power budget.


Q

Q (Quality Factor)  
Dimensionless measure of resonance retention and coherence.

Q_min  
Minimum allowed Q floor.

Q_crit 
Critical Q threshold triggering Barrier.


R

Resonance 
Sustained oscillatory behavior within stable band.



S

Saturation  
Soft limiting near bounds.

Sensor Validity 
Boolean or ratio indicating sensor trustworthiness.

State Frame  
Estimated internal state of system.


T

Throttle  
Soft reduction of gain, coupling, or power.


U

u_control  
Control command.


W

Watchdog  
Timer that detects stalled execution.


Z

Z-Loop  
Closed energetic return path in resonant cycle.
