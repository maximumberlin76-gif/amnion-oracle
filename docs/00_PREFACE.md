Preface (Anthology of Resonance Physics)

1. Medium = a multilayer ensemble of quantum fields, their vacuum states, and condensed phases of matter.

2. It exists as a dynamic fabric where layers continuously exchange modes through interactions and phase transitions.

3. Particles are not “things”, but stable excitations (modes) of this medium.

4. Stability emerges as an attractor where invariants are preserved and the phase is retained.

5. Evolution of the Universe = restructuring of the spectrum of available modes when conditions and symmetries change.

6. Matter and radiation are different resonant regimes of the same scale.

7. Fundamental forces = channels of resonant exchange between layers of the medium.

8. Spacetime = the arena where the spectrum of modes unfolds.

9. Observer = a system capable of resonating with specific modes.

10. Knowledge = establishing resonance with invariants of the medium.

11. Technology = creating conditions for the required resonant regimes.

12. Future of civilization = mastering more complex modes of the medium.
