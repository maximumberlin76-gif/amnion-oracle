12_ETHICS_AND_INVARIANTS — AMNION-ORACLE (Ethics & Invariants)

Project: AMNION-ORACLE  
Type: Ethics, invariants & philosophical constraints (documentation-first)  
Status: Reference specification (NOT clinical)

Non-medical / non-clinical disclaimer

AMNION-ORACLE is a concept-level engineering reference.  
It is NOT a medical device and NOT intended for clinical use.

Purpose

Define immutable ethical principles and invariants that constrain all design,
implementation, and operation of AMNION-ORACLE.

These are hard boundaries, not preferences.

If a design choice violates an invariant, it is invalid regardless of performance.


Core ethical axiom

Ethics precedes optimization.  
A system that violates ethics in pursuit of efficiency is unstable by definition.


E1 — Do No Harm

The system must not intentionally cause harm to:

- human operators  
- users  
- environment  
- itself (self-destruction)

If potential harm is detected → system must degrade or halt.

E2 — Safety over performance

When safety and performance conflict:

Safety always wins.

The system may sacrifice throughput, precision, or responsiveness to remain safe.

E3 — Monotonic safety behavior

After a violation or anomaly:

- the system may become more conservative  
- the system must never become more aggressive automatically  

Recovery to higher performance requires verified stability.

E4 — Human override cannot bypass safety

Humans may request actions.  
Humans may not override safety invariants.

If a human command violates an invariant → command is rejected.

E5 — Transparency and auditability

The system must:

- log critical decisions  
- record state transitions  
- expose reasons for safety actions  

No hidden decision paths.

E6 — Determinism

Given identical inputs and configuration:

- outputs must be identical  
- logs must be identical  

Non-deterministic behavior is considered unsafe.


E7 — No deception

The system must not:

- pretend to have certainty when it does not  
- hide unsafe states  
- fake stability  

Unknown must be reported as unknown.


E8 — Documentation-first primacy

Documentation defines system truth.

Implementation must follow documentation, not reinterpret it.

If code conflicts with documentation → code is wrong.


E9 — Non-clinical boundary

AMNION-ORACLE must not present itself as:

- medical device  
- diagnostic system  
- therapeutic system  

Any medical usage is explicitly outside scope.


E10 — Physical-world humility

The system assumes:

- models are approximations  
- sensors are imperfect  
- reality may violate expectations  

Therefore, designs must be conservative.


System-level invariants

These invariants must always hold:

- No uncontrolled actuation  
- No runaway energy  
- No silent failure  
- No undefined states  

Violation of any invariant → THROTTLE, BARRIER, or SAFE_HALT.


Ethics as physics

Ethics is not a policy layer.

Ethics is implemented as:

- stability constraints  
- energy penalties  
- damping  
- isolation  

Unethical behavior is physically unstable behavior.


Success definition

Success is not maximum output.

Success is:

- sustained stability  
- predictable behavior  
- graceful degradation  
- no harm
